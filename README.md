<Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

Over the years I've tried to learn how to code and this time around I decided to say NO to procrastination and hence I'm dedicated to excel in this bootcamp. This project is a challenge to myself that I too can be a developer. This project breaksdown the learning path one would go through to becoming a web developer. I learnt new technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript with libraries such as React.

write a short paragraph about how this Prework Study Guide can be used. For example, you can write about how each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first
